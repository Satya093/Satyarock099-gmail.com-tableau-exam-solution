Area Graphs in Tableau:
An area graph is a type of data visualization that represents quantitative data over time or a continuous range. It is similar to a line graph but with the area under the line filled with color, creating a visual representation of the data's magnitude. Area graphs are often used to show trends and patterns over time or to compare multiple data series.
Creating an Area Graph in Tableau:
Let's create an example area graph in Tableau using a sample dataset. For this example, I'll use a dataset containing sales data over different months.
1.	Data Preparation: Ensure your dataset is in a tabular format with columns for the time dimension (e.g., months) and the measure (e.g., sales).
2.	Connect to Data: Open Tableau and connect to your dataset by clicking on the "Connect" option and selecting your data source.
3.	Drag and Drop Data:
1.	Drag the date dimension field (e.g., "Month") to the Columns shelf.
2.	Drag the measure field (e.g., "Sales") to the Rows shelf.
4.	Create the Area Graph:
1.	On the Marks card, click on the dropdown and choose "Area" from the list of mark types.
2.	Tableau will automatically create an area graph showing the sales data over time.
5.	Customize the Area Graph:
1.	You can further customize the area graph by adding color, labels, and tooltips to enhance its readability and interactivity.
Line Graphs in Tableau:
A line graph, also known as a line chart, is a basic data visualization that displays data points connected by straight lines. It is commonly used to show trends and patterns in data over time or to compare different categories. In a line graph, each data point is represented as a mark (usually a dot), and the points are connected with lines.
Creating a Line Graph in Tableau:
Let's create an example line graph in Tableau using the same sample dataset as before.
1.	Data Preparation: Ensure your dataset is in a tabular format with columns for the time dimension (e.g., months) and the measure (e.g., sales).
2.	Connect to Data: Open Tableau and connect to your dataset by clicking on the "Connect" option and selecting your data source.
3.	Drag and Drop Data:
•	Drag the date dimension field (e.g., "Month") to the Columns shelf.
•	Drag the measure field (e.g., "Sales") to the Rows shelf.
4.	Create the Line Graph:
•	On the Marks card, click on the dropdown and choose "Line" from the list of mark types.
•	Tableau will automatically create a line graph showing the sales data over time.
5.	Customize the Line Graph:
You can further customize the line graph by adding labels, tooltips, color, and formatting options to make it more informative and visually appealing.
