Tableau supports several types of joins to combine data from multiple tables. The different types of joins supported by Tableau are as follows:

1. **Inner Join:** An inner join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables being joined. In other words, it includes only the data where the join fields match in both tables.

2. **Left Join (or Left Outer Join):** A left join returns all the rows from the left (or first) table and the matching rows from the right (or second) table. If there is no match in the right table, null values are returned for the right table's columns.

3. **Right Join (or Right Outer Join):** A right join returns all the rows from the right (or second) table and the matching rows from the left (or first) table. If there is no match in the left table, null values are returned for the left table's columns.

4. **Full Outer Join:** A full outer join returns all the rows from both tables, combining the results of a left join and a right join. It includes all the data from both tables and fills in null values where there is no match.

5. **Cross Join (or Cartesian Join):** A cross join returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, resulting in a combination of every row from the first table with every row from the second table. It does not rely on a common field for the join and can result in a large number of rows.

6. **Union:** A union is not a join type, but it allows you to combine data from multiple tables with the same structure into a single table. It concatenates the rows from each table vertically, effectively stacking the tables on top of each other.

It's important to note that the appropriate join type to use depends on your data and the analysis or visualization goals. By default, Tableau automatically chooses the join type based on the relationships between the fields in your data sources. However, you can manually select and configure the join type when connecting to your data or in the Data Source tab within Tableau.

Understanding the differences and implications of each join type is crucial in ensuring accurate and meaningful analysis when working with multiple tables in Tableau.
